There are three files in the GitHub repository. The file 'User_purchase_category.ipynb' contains the model for handling the binary classification problem using the Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset. The file called 'garbage_sorting.ipynb' contains the model for processing waste classification images from RealWaste. The compressed file named 'test_fig.rar' includes partial test images for waste classification that can be used for model testing.




The 'User_purchase_category.ipynb' file demonstrates the performance of four additional models (apart from Random Forest) on this dataset.




The 'garbage_sorting.ipynb' file has tested the model's predictions on images of four different waste materials. By modifying the target path to use the test images from the 'test_fig.rar' file, further testing can be conducted. The directions for modifications are indicated in the documentation below.
